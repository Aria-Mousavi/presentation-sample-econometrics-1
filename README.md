# Presentation Sample: Interpreting Econometric Results (Export Subsidy RCT)  
**Date:** November 2025

This folder contains a concise sample of my presentation work, focusing on the empirical results from the paper *“What Do Market-Access Subsidies Do? Experimental Evidence from Tunisia.”*  
I created and presented these slides for the **Development Economics** course taught by **Prof. Adam Szeidl** at Central European University.

### Presentation Approach

- turning complex data and statistical results into clear, decision-relevant insights  
- presenting results in a structured, accessible way for both technical and non-technical audiences  
- extracting the key messages from detailed tables  
- keeping presentations focused, visual, and easy to follow
